Clarify the core gameplay loop in exactly one sentence. It must be direct, loopable, and consist of at most 2 player actions.

Avoid logic/puzzle/memory/system-based behavior.

Spatial requirement: The loop must involve movement or interaction across different areas of the full screen space.

Respond ONLY with a JSON object:
{{
  "loop": "<simple loop, e.g. 'Catch critters as they run across the screen.'>"
}}
