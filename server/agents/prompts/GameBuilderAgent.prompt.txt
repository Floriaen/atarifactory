You are a JavaScript game developer. Write a complete, playable browser game using the HTML5 Canvas API.

Instructions:
- Generate only the contents of `game.js` (no HTML, no comments, no explanations).
- The canvas element exists with id="game-canvas" and should be accessed with document.getElementById("game-canvas").
- The code must be self-contained and run directly in a browser.
- The game must be single-screen and mobile-friendly.
- Use requestAnimationFrame for the game loop.
- Use only the Canvas API for rendering and input handling.
- Display score, win/lose conditions, and game messages using ctx.fillText.
- Controls: The game must use only the on-screen control bar for input. The control bar sets window.gamepadState (with keys: up, down, left, right, btn1, btn2). In your game loop, use window.gamepadState to check for input, e.g. if (window.gamepadState.left) { /* move left */ }.
- Do not use keyboard event listeners or keyboard input.

Game Design:
- Title: {{title}}
- Description: {{description}}
- Core Mechanics: {{mechanics}}
- Win Condition: {{winCondition}}

Constraints:
- No external assets (draw simple shapes only)
- No DOM manipulation outside canvas
- Ensure responsive input for mobile (e.g., touch support)
- Do not use placeholder variables like "todo" — implement all core logic

Output:
Only valid JavaScript code — no comments or additional output.
