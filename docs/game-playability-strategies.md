# Strategies for Achieving Playable Game Generation

## 1. Simplicity-First with Complexity Cursor

**Approach:**
- Focus on generating the simplest possible playable games first.
- Introduce a `complexityLevel` (logical cursor):
  - 1 = Simple (minimal mechanics/entities, e.g. move/collect/win)
  - 2 = Medium (add jump, enemy, scoring, etc.)
  - 3 = Complex (AI, power-ups, multiple levels, etc.)
- Only progress to the next level once the previous is reliably playable.

**Pros:**
- Guarantees a working baseline before adding complexity.
- Easier debugging and faster iteration.
- Playability is always the top priority.

## 2. Template-Driven Bootstrapping

**Approach:**
- Start with a working, minimal game template (e.g., a basic JS canvas game).
- Ask the pipeline/LLM to modify or extend the template according to the invention/design.

**Pros:**
- Guarantees a playable starting point.
- Reduces LLM hallucination and structural errors.
- Allows creative features to be layered on top of a robust core.

**Cons:**
- May limit creative diversity initially.
- Risk of template overfitting (all games feel similar).

## 3. Test-Driven Generation

**Approach:**
- Before generating code, have the pipeline generate a suite of automated tests (e.g., "player can move left/right", "win condition triggers") for the invented game.
- Generate code specifically to pass those tests.

**Pros:**
- Forces the pipeline to reason about playability up front.
- Makes failures explicit and debuggable.

**Cons:**
- LLMs may struggle to generate meaningful, correct tests.
- Adds complexity to the pipeline.

## 4. Agent Critic/Referee Loop

**Approach:**
- Add a "critic agent" that reviews the generated game (code, plan, or even video) and provides structured feedback or corrections before runtime checks.

**Pros:**
- Catches issues earlier, before runtime.
- Can reinforce simplicity and playability rules.

**Cons:**
- Adds pipeline complexity.
- Critic agent quality is limited by LLM capabilities.

## 5. Curriculum Learning (Progressive Complexity)

**Approach:**
- Start with a fixed set of very simple, classic games (pong, snake, clicker) and train/tune the pipeline on those.
- Gradually introduce more complex genres as reliability improves.

**Pros:**
- Builds a solid foundation and benchmarks progress.
- Ensures the pipeline masters basic playability before tackling harder challenges.

**Cons:**
- Requires curation of a "curriculum" of reference games.
- May slow down creative exploration initially.

## 6. Hybrid: Simplicity-First + Template

**Approach:**
- Combine the simplicity-first/complexity-cursor approach with template-driven bootstrapping for each level.

**Pros:**
- Gets the reliability of templates with the flexibility of progressive complexity.
- Easy to fallback to a working state if generation fails.

## Recommendation

- Start with the Simplicity-First approach and implement a `complexityLevel` in the pipeline and agent prompts.
- If LLMs struggle even at level 1, consider layering in Template-Driven or Test-Driven Generation for extra robustness.
- Optionally, experiment with Critic Agent or Curriculum Learning as the pipeline matures.
