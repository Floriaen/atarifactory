# LangChain Migration Plan for Game Spec Pipeline

## Overview
This plan details the recommended strategy for migrating the game specification pipeline and agents to LangChain, with a test-driven approach. The focus is on ensuring robust E2E and unit testing from the start, enabling incremental migration and rapid validation.

---

## Migration Steps (Test-First)

### 1. Set Up LangChain & Test Harness
- Install LangChain and any required LLM backends (`npm install langchain openai`).
- Create a new directory for LangChain-based agents and pipeline (`server/agents/langchain/`).
- Set up a new E2E test file (e.g., `server/tests/e2e/GamePipelineLangChain.e2e.test.js`).
- In the E2E test, outline the desired pipeline flow and expected outputs using mocks or fixtures.

### 2. Write E2E Test for the Pipeline (First)
- Define the expected pipeline steps and outputs in the E2E test.
- Use deterministic mocks for LLM outputs to ensure reproducibility.
- The test should:
  - Call the future LangChain pipeline (to be implemented).
  - Assert that the pipeline completes without error.
  - Assert on the structure and validity of the returned gameDef and plan.
  - Optionally, check that auto-fix and iterative loops work as expected.

### 3. Migrate Agents Incrementally
- For each agent (GameInventorAgent, GameDesignAgent, etc.):
  - Refactor as a LangChain `LLMChain` or custom chain/tool.
  - Write or update unit tests for the agent using LangChain's interfaces.
  - Ensure the E2E test passes each time an agent is migrated.

### 4. Compose the Pipeline
- Use `SequentialChain` (or `AgentExecutor` for iterative/looping flows) to compose the migrated agents.
- Update the E2E test to run the composed pipeline.
- Add memory/context passing if needed.

### 5. Parallel Run & Validation
- Temporarily keep both the old and new pipelines.
- Run both on the same inputs and compare outputs in the E2E test.
- Once confident, deprecate the old pipeline.

### 6. Documentation & Cleanup
- Update project docs to explain the new LangChain-based architecture and test approach.
- Remove legacy code after migration is complete.

## Example Migration Order (Test-Driven)

1. **Write E2E test for LangChain pipeline (with mocks).**
2. Migrate GameInventorAgent to LangChain chain + unit test.
3. Migrate GameDesignAgent to LangChain chain + unit test.
4. Migrate PlayabilityValidatorAgent to LangChain chain + unit test.
5. Migrate PlayabilityAutoFixAgent to LangChain chain + unit test.
6. Migrate PlannerAgent to LangChain chain + unit test.
7. Compose pipeline as SequentialChain/AgentExecutor.
8. Ensure E2E test passes with each migration.
9. Remove old code and update docs.

## Benefits of This Approach
- **Test-driven:** Ensures correctness at every step.
- **Incremental:** Can validate each migration before moving on.
- **Parallelizable:** Team members can work on different agents/tests at the same time.
- **Robust:** E2E and unit tests catch regressions early.
- **Future-proof:** Easy to extend pipeline with new agents or features.
