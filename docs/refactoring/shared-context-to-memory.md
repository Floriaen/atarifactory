**Topic:** Structured context exposure to LangChain-compatible components

---

### Summary

The factory architecture uses a `SharedContext` object to persist and pass around structured state (e.g., game title, plan, current step) across all agents.

Rather than replace this with LangChain’s memory system, we introduce a custom **SharedContextMemoryAdapter** to expose selected fields to LangChain components like `LLMChain` and `PromptTemplate`.

---

### Implementation

- `SharedContext` remains the **single source of truth**
- `SharedContextMemoryAdapter` implements the LangChain memory interface:
  - `.loadMemoryVariables()` returns a flat key-value object derived from `SharedContext`
  - `.saveContext()` is optional (can be used for logging or feedback if needed)

**Example returned variables:**
```json
{
  "game_title": "Gem Jumper",
  "step_description": "Add coins and scoring"
}
```

---

### Benefits

- No duplication of state or logic
- LangChain can auto-fill prompt variables
- Full control remains inside custom orchestration
- Compatible with structured planning and debugging

---

### Notes

This approach is what we referred to as:
“Custom variables injection (from a shared state or store)”
It bridges deterministic agent state and flexible prompt templates.
