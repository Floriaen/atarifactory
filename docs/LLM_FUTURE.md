# What About the Future?

## LLMs With Web Access or Plugins
Some LLMs (like GPT-4 with browsing, or models with retrieval plugins) can check the latest docs and adapt to new APIs.

In the future, you could prompt the LLM:
> "Check the latest Phaser 3 documentation and generate a game using only supported APIs."

This would make explicit instructions less necessary.

## Self-Validation and Testing
Future LLMs may be able to run/test the code they generate, or check it against live documentation, and fix issues automatically.

## Automatic Prompt Updating
You could automate prompt updates by scraping the latest docs and feeding them to the LLM as context.

# LLM Future Improvements

## âœ… Completed Improvements

- **âœ… ESM Migration:** Codebase successfully migrated to ESM with "type": "module" in package.json
- **âœ… Prompt Externalization:** All LLM prompts moved to `server/agents/prompts/` as `.md` files
- **âœ… Modern Langchain Integration:** All chains use `chainFactory.js` with structured output and Zod schemas
- **âœ… Type Safety:** Zod schemas provide runtime validation and type safety
- **âœ… SharedState Improvements:** Proper SharedState type with validation in `server/types/SharedState.js`

## ðŸš§ Current Architecture Status

- **chainFactory Pattern:** All chains use standardized `createStandardChain()`, `createJSONChain()`, etc.
- **Structured Output:** Automatic schema validation with `.withStructuredOutput()` and Zod
- **Token Counting:** Built-in token tracking via callback system
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit/integration tests with `MockLLM` supporting structured output

## ðŸ”® Future Improvements

- **Advanced LLM Features:**
  - Explore function calling and tool usage for more complex agent interactions
  - Implement streaming responses for real-time progress updates
  - Add support for multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, Google, etc.)

- **Enhanced Pipeline:**
  - Add caching layer for expensive chain operations
  - Implement pipeline branching for alternative generation paths
  - Add A/B testing framework for prompt optimization

- **Developer Experience:**
  - Add TypeScript for better IDE support and type checking
  - Create visual pipeline debugger for chain execution tracing
  - Implement hot-reload for prompt files during development
