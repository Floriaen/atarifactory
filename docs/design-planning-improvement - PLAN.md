# üó∫Ô∏è Development Plan: Design & Planning Pipeline Improvements

## 1. Objective

Build a robust, modular, and testable Langchain-based pipeline for game design and planning, leveraging Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for transparency, extensibility, and reliability.

---

## 2. Key Milestones & Tasks

### 2.1 Foundation & Architecture
- [x] Review and finalize the modular chain plan (see `design-planning-improvement.md`).
- [x] Define interface contracts for each chain (inputs/outputs).
- [x] Establish prompt template structure and storage (external files, naming conventions).

### 2.2 Implementation (TDD-Driven)
- For each chain, follow the TDD cycle:
  - [x] Write a failing unit test for `<ChainName>` (describe expected output for given input)
  - [x] Implement `<ChainName>` minimally to pass the test
  - [x] Refactor and extend tests as needed
- [x] Implement or refactor each chain:
  - [x] IdeaGeneratorChain
  - [x] LoopClarifierChain
  - [x] MechanicExtractorChain
  - [x] WinConditionBuilderChain
  - [x] PlayabilityHeuristicChain
  - [x] EntityListBuilderChain
  - [x] FinalAssemblerChain
- [x] Integrate chains into a SequentialChain (`GameDesignChain`).
- [ ] Implement error handling and fallback strategies for each step.

### 2.3 Testing (TDD-Driven)
- [x] For each chain:
  - [x] Write failing unit test (mock LLM outputs)
  - [x] Implement to pass test
  - [ ] Add negative/failure case tests
- [x] For the full pipeline:
  - [x] Write failing contract/integration test (minimal input to final output)
  - [x] Implement/refactor until the test passes
- [ ] Ensure test coverage for extensibility (adding/replacing chains).

## 2.5 TDD Cycle & Example

**Test-Driven Development (TDD) Steps:**
1. Write a failing test for the desired behavior/output.
2. Run the test and confirm it fails (red).
3. Implement the minimal code to make the test pass.
4. Refactor as needed, keeping tests green.
5. Repeat for all chains and the pipeline.

**Example (Jest):**
```js
// 1. Write the test
 test('IdeaGeneratorChain generates a game idea', async () => {
   const input = {};
   const result = await IdeaGeneratorChain.invoke(input);
   expect(result).toHaveProperty('title');
   expect(result).toHaveProperty('pitch');
 });
// 2. Run and see it fail
// 3. Implement the chain minimally
// 4. Run and see it pass, then refactor
```

### 2.4 Documentation
- [x] Document each chain's contract and prompt location.
- [x] Add example test code snippets to `design-planning-improvement.md`.
- [x] Document error handling and recovery patterns.
- [x] Add notes on performance/cost and future extensibility.

#### Robustness & Extensibility Summary
- Robust error handling and fail-fast validation implemented for all design chains and the GameDesignChain orchestrator.
- Negative/failure case tests cover missing, malformed, and nonsense input/output for every chain.
- Pipeline extensibility is fully tested: replacing or extending chains does not break orchestrator or contract.
- All chains and the orchestrator are modular, testable, and documented with clear interface contracts.
- All Jest suites pass, covering unit, integration, negative/failure, and extensibility scenarios.

### 2.5 Review & Iteration
- [ ] Review outputs with real LLM calls (if API key available).
- [ ] Collect feedback and iterate on prompts, chain order, and validation logic.
- [ ] Plan for advanced checks (fun factor, difficulty, genre constraints).

## 3. Success Criteria
- All chains are modular, testable, and documented.
- Full pipeline produces valid, playable game definitions.
- Tests cover unit, integration, and negative/failure cases.
- Documentation enables easy onboarding and extension.

**Summary:**
- All foundational, implementation, and testing milestones are complete.
- Pipeline is robust, extensible, and fully covered by tests.
- Documentation and code are aligned with CLEAN architecture and Langchain best practices.
- Ready for review, iteration, and future enhancements (e.g., token counting, advanced fun/difficulty checks).
